**AMECovDock - Automated Modeling Engine for covelent docking using ADFR**

This package holds everything needed to automate ADFR

In a covalently bound ligand, there are three atoms shared between the receptor and the ligand. It includes a common anchor atom in the receptor that connects with the ligandâ€™s atoms. You can see both connected atoms in the PDBQT files of both the receptor and the ligand as well.

For with a receptor using  ADFR [1-2]  follows https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/tutorial-covalent/

**OUTPUT**
==============
./Res_Dock/
    for ease of comparison and visualization of results
    receptorName_ligandName_reactionName_counter_jobName_out.pdbqt - the docked ligand
    scores.txt                                                     - list of docked ligands sorted by score

./output/
    additional information about docked ligands
    ./output/ligandName_reactionName_counter/
        .dro file          - from ADFR
        summary.dlg file   - from ADFR
        atoms.txt          - atom numbers chosen for docking, for additional validation

./pdb/
    for ease of re-docking and input validation
    .pdb    - result of AMECovDock_Reactions.py
    .pdbqt  - result of adfr prepare_ligand

===============
**ENVIRONMENT** - Constance
===============
module load python/anaconda3.2019.3
source /share/apps/python/anaconda3.2019.3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate my-rdkit-env
module load gcc/6.1.0
module load openbabel/2.4.1

===============
DEPENDENCIES
===============
ADFR - http://adfr.scripps.edu/AutoDockFR/downloads.html
anaconda
rdkit - https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html
gcc - used on Constance for compatibility with slurm

==============
NOTES - SETUP
==============
only 2 files need to be provided
  {ligand_file}.smi
    2 columns, no header: SMILES ID
  {receptor}_cov.trg
    for example run this command on your receptor.pdbqt (6wqf in this case)
    agfr -r 6wqf.pdbqt -b user -17.00 -5.00 15.00 40.00 40.00 40.00 -c 1379 1382 -t 1377 -x A:CYS145 -o 6wqf_cov

in AMECovDock_ADFR.sh
  modify  lines 14- 16     - receptor code, {ligand_file} base name, /path/to/ADFR/Installation/bin/
  modify lines 42-45       - Residue Number
in AMECovDock_Reactions.py
  modify line 99           - {ligand_file}.smi goes in supplier
  modify line 223          - SetResidueNumber

resulting files show
    receptorName - for keeping track of what receptorthe ligand was docked to
    ligandName   - for referencing ligand with original input
    reactionName - for easily identifying which warhead reacted with the receptor, may also be used to filter results according to interest
    counter      - when a reaction produces multiple unique products, the counter prevents them from overwriting

=================
TO RUN
./AMECovDock_ADFR.sh
